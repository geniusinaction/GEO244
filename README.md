Included here are a series of Jupyter notebooks that make use of real GNSS and InSAR data:

## [00_set_up_environment](00_set_up_environment/)
Includes a conda YML file for an environment for the class, and instructions on how to use it.

## [01_download_earthscope_data](01_download_earthscope_data/)
A Jupyter notebook for setting up a SSO token for downloading data from EarthScope.

## [02_gnss_time_series_decomposition](02_gnss_time_series_decomposition/)
A Jupyter notebook demonstrating ways of decomposing a GNSS time series $-$ detrending, solving for offsets, solving for postseismic transients and removing seasonal signals.
